2016-02-05 02:33:42	henrythehurricane	I am so fucking done with this shit. I'm only 18 years old and I'm already so tired of it all. My parents think I'm just attention-whoring. God damn them. I got beat up in high school, and now I'm in college. Things still haven't gotten better. I'm ready to go through with it. I'm ready for death. I've got a plan, and I'm going to execute it. I'm done.

There's nothing to stay for and no purpose if I stay. I won't ever make an impact. I'm average, perhaps even below average. I have no talents to offer, and I'm a disappointment to my parents. I have a myriad of other problems as well.

I'm not worth anyone's time and I guess I should just end it. I have been traumatized with no help, nor will ever have the support like others get. I'm worthless and I hope you all laugh when I'm dead.

2016-02-06 03:17:57	xiaojun_chen	 I've been sitting on the floor of my living room for two days. My apartment is a mess and I don't have it in me to clean it up. I wake up in the morning and start crying. I'm 35 years old and have nothing to wake up for. I've never had a relationship last more than a few months.   
2016-02-06 03:18:50	AriettaWren	xiaojun_chen, what are your hobbies?

2016-02-06 03:22:57	xiaojun_chen	   it's just that she's basically my only real life friend, and my online friends seem to be ignoring me or something. Also, I was bullied a bit today and I started crying, which I know is immature and stuff because I'm 13, but I couldn't help it, then that part of my head, the depressing part, started making me think of suicide and stuff like that.

2016-02-06 03:43:47	artemisfo	jealousy has nothing to do with love or something like and I hate it because I can't controll this feeling
2016-02-06 03:43:59	artemisfo	sorry thats not the whole message
2016-02-06 03:44:03	AriettaWren	describe the feeling
2016-02-06 03:44:21	AriettaWren	maybe you should put more depth into your interest in girls
2016-02-06 03:44:31	ChubbyChased	artemisfo, that used to happen to me too but when i was like 14
2016-02-06 03:47:43	artemisfo	It feels like a combination of anger and fear, like Im scared to be left alone on the one hand and on the other hand I just want to destroy something. I don't know if Im just too decent or if I dont have the balls but Im not the type of guy who do violent things against people, but against things
2016-02-06 03:48:36	artemisfo	And ChubbyChased, Im not really into irc, so if your message was private, I have no clue how to response private
2016-02-06 03:48:52	ChubbyChased	¿?
2016-02-06 03:49:41	artemisfo	the font color of your name is golden and the others are green, thats why I thought your message was private or something
2016-02-06 03:51:22	ChubbyChased	ohh lol, that happens when someone types your nick (known as "highlighting")
2016-02-06 03:51:25	ChubbyChased	artemisfo, see? 
2016-02-06 03:54:00	artemisfo	oh ok, the more you (or in this case I) know
2016-02-06 03:56:24	AriettaWren	I don't know, I don't understand because I don't share similar feelings and I've never dealt with them
2016-02-06 03:58:06	artemisfo	What I'd like to add to the "jealousy topic", I think I need more selfesteem and I have to learn how to trust people. Its anoying when you can't sleep because a girl who isn't even your girlfriend is at a party and you are scared that she could fuck someone else. She even wrote me that everything is funny and asks what I am doing and stuff like that. 
2016-02-06 03:58:32	artemisfo	thats just stupid
2016-02-06 04:01:44	ChubbyChased	artemisfo, how old are you?
2016-02-06 04:01:49	artemisfo	24
2016-02-06 04:02:10	ChubbyChased	i see...
2016-02-06 04:02:50	artemisfo	?
2016-02-06 04:03:12	ChubbyChased	That's usually a problem of self-steem m8
2016-02-06 04:04:38	AriettaWren	artemisfo, the girl you're not involved with, I'm guessing you want to be
2016-02-06 04:04:52	AriettaWren	and if you're worried about her meeting and being with someone else, you should pursue her
2016-02-06 04:05:02	AriettaWren	and make your interest known
2016-02-06 04:05:44	ChubbyChased	AriettaWren, i think his problem that he's jelly about other guys having fun with girls 
2016-02-06 04:05:49	ChubbyChased	or that was the other guy?
2016-02-06 04:06:24	AriettaWren	artemisfo, so it's just girls in general or girls you could potentially be in a relationship with
2016-02-06 04:08:56	artemisfo	No there is not other guy, thats the point. I just can't relax because I always imagine what could maybe happen. Today its about one girl, and yes I like her. But it also happened before with girls who I just met a party or something and talked to them. I really hate this because I know thats bullshit. And yes, you are right, I should tell her what I feel but even imagine this situation makes me feel like I will collapse
2016-02-06 04:12:23	artemisfo	Its like "I saw her first, shes mine, so gtf away from her" - And thats just stupid
2016-02-06 04:13:18	AriettaWren	well admitting there's a problem is the first step and you've done that, so just call yourself a dumbass every time you go down that line of thought
2016-02-06 04:14:24	artemisfo	Thank you for your help, I think you are both right.

2016-02-07 12:55:32	&Segger	it looks cooler now, and uses proper velocities for the the blorbs
2016-02-07 12:55:55	&Segger	Also there's collision on them now
2016-02-07 12:55:56	&Lysana	I like it Segger
2016-02-07 12:56:00	&Segger	:3 thx
2016-02-07 12:56:54	&Lysana	Well totally would have liked to worka  bit on that one with you...
2016-02-07 12:56:58	&Lysana	pretty up my ally
2016-02-07 12:57:12	&Segger	ally? wuh?
2016-02-07 12:57:16	&Lysana	they seem to grow too much if they eat
2016-02-07 12:57:25	&Segger	nah, they'll grow to 200% and stop
2016-02-07 12:57:40	&Lysana	they should grow more slowly
2016-02-07 12:57:44	&Lysana	while they digest i'd say
2016-02-07 12:57:53	&Lysana	and not just jump grow ^^
2016-02-07 12:57:55	&Lysana	but yeah
2016-02-07 12:57:57	&Segger	Yeah, they digest at interval though
2016-02-07 12:57:57	&Lysana	it's cool
2016-02-07 12:58:13	&Lysana	the blinks are nice
2016-02-07 12:58:15	&Segger	basically they each have a timer that governs how quickly they metabolize stuff
2016-02-07 12:58:18	&Lysana	do they resemble something?
2016-02-07 12:58:28	&Segger	yeah the blinking is them sniffing for food
2016-02-07 12:58:37	&Segger	They actually search for food in the radius of the circle
2016-02-07 12:58:46	&Lysana	ah okay
2016-02-07 12:58:51	&Lysana	nice
2016-02-07 12:58:56	&Segger	When they're hungry or dying they sniff at faster rates and at farther
2016-02-07 12:59:02	&Segger	ranges
2016-02-07 12:59:04	&Lysana	and they don't follow lines anymore
2016-02-07 12:59:12	&Segger	exactly
2016-02-07 12:59:15	&Lysana	pretty cool
2016-02-07 12:59:21	&Segger	They used to clip directly to food as well
2016-02-07 12:59:32	&Segger	And they would all just snap to each one immediately
2016-02-07 12:59:33	&Segger	it was weird
2016-02-07 12:59:43	&Lysana	now you need to make them breed and replicate =3
2016-02-07 13:00:09	&Lysana	and make them start cannibalise if you do not feed them
2016-02-07 13:00:22	&Segger	Yeah, that's why I haven't polished up their eating and stuff more
2016-02-07 13:00:30	&Segger	I was workin on the core stuff instead of more polish
2016-02-07 13:00:52	&Lysana	looks kinda polished compared to what it has been like
2016-02-07 13:01:06	&Lysana	well as said i'd be up to work on you with that...
2016-02-07 13:01:12	&Lysana	but i guess you'd rather be on yourself

2016-02-07 13:04:35	&Segger	Yeah I like doin this one by myself

2016-02-07 22:04:24	AriettaWren	probably. I tried to resolve it on my own at various points before

2016-02-07 22:04:41	AriettaWren	I'm in sc

2016-02-07 22:05:36	AriettaWren	how long have you been out of school? what were you in school for?
2016-02-07 22:05:38	AriettaWren	and yeah
2016-02-07 22:05:49	AriettaWren	where in europe are you from?
2016-02-07 22:06:07	groke	Its been almost a year now. I studied engineering.
2016-02-07 22:06:16	groke	Sweden (not Switzerland).
2016-02-07 22:06:55	groke	It would been so much easier if I could disccuss problems with my parents, but I cant really talk to them. How about you?
2016-02-07 22:07:30	AriettaWren	I have a close relationship with my mom

2016-02-07 22:09:15	groke	Mm well at least you're doing something about it now.
2016-02-07 22:09:28	groke	No point in grieving about lost time.
2016-02-07 22:09:37	AriettaWren	yeah, and I'm only 20
2016-02-07 22:09:54	groke	Ah alright, yeah it's good then you fix it early on.
2016-02-07 22:10:15	groke	What do you think is the underlying problem?
2016-02-07 22:10:46	groke	.quote
2016-02-07 22:10:50	groke	(how does that work..)
2016-02-07 22:10:51	AriettaWren	there's a few things with me, social anxiety is definitely one
2016-02-07 22:11:22	AriettaWren	but I also struggle socially in connecting with people/finding a fit in anything I do that isn't by myself
2016-02-07 22:11:38	groke	Have you heard about avoidant personality? I think I have that.
2016-02-07 22:11:49	AriettaWren	I guess motivation is connected to depression, and I'm depressed by the other stuff, but I'm not motivated to do more than I do
2016-02-07 22:11:59	AriettaWren	and I struggle to see what to do in terms of a future career
2016-02-07 22:12:43	groke	Yeah, motivation is an interesting problem. Some people see it as something that people either magically have or don't. I don't think it works like that.
2016-02-07 22:13:11	AriettaWren	do you have any hobbies?
2016-02-07 22:13:24	groke	You could become a counsellor,, you seem good at talking to depressed guys :p
2016-02-07 22:14:00	AriettaWren	I'd struggle to talk to you in person
2016-02-07 22:14:01	groke	Well, my hobbies at the moment are also solitary. I exercise. I used to read, but haven't in a while.
2016-02-07 22:14:17	groke	I am not scary. 
2016-02-07 22:14:48	AriettaWren	I play guitar https://soundcloud.com/dont-read-this-814362960

2016-02-09 06:12:02	migraine	lol
2016-02-09 06:12:18	Agent-E	problem is, everything is connected to the back
2016-02-09 06:12:23	Agent-E	so legs, arms, neck
2016-02-09 06:12:25	groke	Start a hobby like reading or drawing
2016-02-09 06:12:28	AriettaWren	women also shouldn't be allowed to vote

2016-02-09 06:12:36	Agent-E	heh
2016-02-09 06:12:42	AriettaWren	but that could be resolved by restricting votes to property owners
2016-02-09 06:12:45	AriettaWren	mostly
2016-02-09 06:12:49	migraine	lol
2016-02-09 06:12:54	AriettaWren	or networth
2016-02-09 06:12:57	migraine	this retard again
2016-02-09 06:12:58	groke	Yes arietta u raise an important point
2016-02-09 06:13:25	AriettaWren	you can't vote unless you have at least 250k net worth would be reasonable
2016-02-09 06:13:34	groke	Mm
2016-02-09 06:13:37	Agent-E	ha no thx
2016-02-09 06:13:41	AriettaWren	:p

2016-02-09 06:13:54	groke	And 30 years
2016-02-09 06:13:57	groke	Min
2016-02-09 06:14:00	Agent-E	30 yrs old
2016-02-09 06:14:01	AriettaWren	well those would just be factors
2016-02-09 06:14:07	AriettaWren	of the net worth voting restriction
2016-02-09 06:14:16	Agent-E	net worth...
2016-02-09 06:14:20	AriettaWren	because there wouldn't be as many women at any age that met that requirement
2016-02-09 06:14:28	Agent-E	then the %2 could vote for the %1 !
2016-02-09 06:14:39	Agent-E	:)
2016-02-09 06:14:39	AriettaWren	muh 1%
2016-02-09 06:14:46	Agent-E	mm hm
2016-02-09 06:14:50	AriettaWren	that's nonsense
2016-02-09 06:14:56	Agent-E	sure
2016-02-09 06:15:01	AriettaWren	and forced wealth distribution is immoral
2016-02-09 06:15:05	AriettaWren	so is taxation
2016-02-09 06:15:08	Agent-E	when 650 ppl have the same wealth as the whole world
2016-02-09 06:15:19	Agent-E	somethings gone awry
2016-02-09 06:15:26	AriettaWren	don't blame the player, blame the game
2016-02-09 06:15:29	Agent-E	so basically
2016-02-09 06:15:40	Agent-E	only the wealthy voting would mean
2016-02-09 06:15:41	AriettaWren	the only reason they get that way is government bailouts
2016-02-09 06:15:49	Agent-E	only the leaders who favor the rich will win
2016-02-09 06:15:51	AriettaWren	if you had unrestricted free markets
2016-02-09 06:15:58	AriettaWren	everything would be fine
2016-02-09 06:16:04	AriettaWren	and everyone would benefit
2016-02-09 06:16:07	Agent-E	oh yeh
2016-02-09 06:16:18	AriettaWren	no leaders
2016-02-09 06:16:20	AriettaWren	only capital
2016-02-09 06:16:25	AriettaWren	anarcho capitalism
2016-02-09 06:16:26	Agent-E	hm
2016-02-09 06:16:37	Agent-E	dunno how well that'd work
2016-02-09 06:17:06	Agent-E	but its nice to know u make over 250k
2016-02-09 06:17:16	Agent-E	u must be very proud of yourself
2016-02-09 06:17:23	AriettaWren	you don't have to make over 250k to have 250k net worth
2016-02-09 06:17:26	AriettaWren	well
2016-02-09 06:17:29	Agent-E	ah
2016-02-09 06:17:31	AriettaWren	anually I mean
2016-02-09 06:17:36	AriettaWren	you can build it up in investments
2016-02-09 06:17:39	Agent-E	yeah i know
2016-02-09 06:17:48	AriettaWren	*annually
2016-02-09 06:17:58	Agent-E	if u had a house worth 250K yer worth 250K
2016-02-09 06:18:02	Agent-E	i get it
2016-02-09 06:18:27	Agent-E	but still
2016-02-09 06:18:37	Agent-E	you cant just ignore %80 of the world population
2016-02-09 06:18:42	AriettaWren	but that'd be a transitional thing
2016-02-09 06:18:49	AriettaWren	ideally there'd be no voting or democracy
2016-02-09 06:18:54	Agent-E	mm hm
2016-02-09 06:18:59	AriettaWren	it'd just be investing, voting with money
2016-02-09 06:19:07	groke	Lol
2016-02-09 06:19:08	AriettaWren	I don't think you should be able to vote without a stake in things
2016-02-09 06:19:19	Agent-E	and thus the poor dont get represented
2016-02-09 06:19:23	AriettaWren	otherwise you have minorities flooding in and politicians encouraging them because they vote a certain way
2016-02-09 06:19:23	groke	Dude

2016-02-09 06:33:17	AriettaWren	yeah?
2016-02-09 06:33:43	groke	The value of what he does is not same as the price of the thing

2016-02-09 06:35:59	groke	Tell me how
2016-02-09 06:36:00	AriettaWren	because you can't get a party of people large enough
2016-02-09 06:36:06	AriettaWren	that all agree to do their assigned jobs
2016-02-09 06:36:13	AriettaWren	just to publicly own the thing at the end of it
2016-02-09 06:36:22	groke	U still havent told
2016-02-09 06:36:28	AriettaWren	it only works small scale, and small scale isn't good enough
2016-02-09 06:36:39	groke	How can price and value differ
2016-02-09 06:36:54	AriettaWren	value is whatever value is given to it by the people that want it
2016-02-09 06:36:55	groke	If u cant tell then u arent following logic
2016-02-09 06:37:19	AriettaWren	value is assigned, it isn't set in stone and it isn't inherent
2016-02-09 06:37:34	groke	Who put the value into the product?
2016-02-09 06:37:48	AriettaWren	whoever decides to pay for it
2016-02-09 06:37:52	groke	I.e. Who mafe it
2016-02-09 06:37:56	groke	Made
2016-02-09 06:37:58	AriettaWren	they could negotiate the price if they wanted to
2016-02-09 06:38:13	AriettaWren	if you set the value too high, it doesn't sell
2016-02-09 06:38:17	AriettaWren	too low, you don't profit
2016-02-09 06:39:03	groke	The value of the work is what the thing is sold for?
2016-02-09 06:39:16	AriettaWren	the value of the work is whatever the person agrees to work for
2016-02-09 06:39:25	AriettaWren	"my labor is worth x amount"
2016-02-09 06:39:39	AriettaWren	you can negotiate your pay as well
2016-02-09 06:39:40	groke	Labor is not a commodity

2016-02-09 06:40:10	AriettaWren	no it isn't
2016-02-09 06:40:22	groke	Thats ridiculous tho
2016-02-09 06:40:25	AriettaWren	a bunch of people working really hard bashing their face against a wall
2016-02-09 06:40:28	AriettaWren	has no value

2016-02-09 06:41:27	groke	Sure it has to be of use,  dont deny that
2016-02-09 06:41:36	AriettaWren	it has the value of the warm look on the persons face you give it to :p
2016-02-09 06:41:59	Agent-E	sigh
2016-02-09 06:42:13	Agent-E	red n blue
2016-02-09 06:42:22	groke	Well so it has some value
2016-02-09 06:42:25	AriettaWren	you could measure its value in what someone theoretically would buy it for if you were selling it
2016-02-09 06:42:28	AriettaWren	but that's meaningless
2016-02-09 06:42:35	BEY_DAN_GAN	Where is Reladhi

2016-02-09 06:44:01	groke	Workers dont get payed the value of their work
2016-02-09 06:44:08	AriettaWren	they do
2016-02-09 06:44:24	AriettaWren	the value of their work is whatever they agree that it is
2016-02-09 06:44:24	groke	Bacause some capitalist take a slice without having contributed
2016-02-09 06:44:38	AriettaWren	if they don't agree, they don't work, or they work for someone else
2016-02-09 06:44:43	AriettaWren	that values them higher

2016-02-09 06:44:50	groke	This is why we need to arm ourselves
2016-02-09 06:45:18	AriettaWren	so you can shoot your employer for paying the wage you agreed to work for?

2016-02-09 06:45:45	AriettaWren	they aren't holding a gun to your head
2016-02-09 06:45:53	groke	I explained it with marxist arguments
2016-02-09 06:45:58	AriettaWren	no you didn't
2016-02-09 06:46:09	AriettaWren	there is no marxist argument and marxism is all wrong
2016-02-09 06:46:47	AriettaWren	being against capitalism is like being against water or air
2016-02-09 06:46:53	groke	When u say agreeing to work, u play the game of the capitalists
2016-02-09 06:47:04	AriettaWren	it's not a game
2016-02-09 06:47:17	groke	Sure in that framework, its perfectly right
2016-02-09 06:47:27	groke	But we dont need to accept it
2016-02-09 06:47:31	AriettaWren	that framework is just the factual reality of life

2016-02-09 06:48:50	AriettaWren	when just removing the government would resolve all of your issues with capitalism
2016-02-09 06:49:00	AriettaWren	and capitalism is just a fact of free individuals existing
2016-02-09 06:49:08	groke	Who get meds? The one in need or the one who can afford? This is murder.

2016-02-09 06:49:51	Agent-E	depends on where u are i guess
2016-02-09 06:49:52	AriettaWren	capitalism will also bring us to colonize other planets

2016-02-09 07:34:50	AriettaWren	and they gain their power at the expense of others
2016-02-09 07:35:04	%LM22	Do business owners not do this now?
2016-02-09 07:35:04	AriettaWren	here's the difference
2016-02-09 07:35:09	AriettaWren	I'm in favor of voluntary hierarchy
2016-02-09 07:35:23	AriettaWren	they're in favor of forced hierarchy
2016-02-09 07:35:44	AriettaWren	you're in favor of pretend land where everyone is equal and can do anything
2016-02-09 07:36:04	%LM22	"voluntary hierarchy" When the question is, be at the bottom or die, is it really voluntary?
2016-02-09 07:36:13	%LM22	Also you're putting words in my mouth
2016-02-09 07:36:28	%LM22	It would be nice if everyone were equal, but that's impossible 
2016-02-09 07:36:32	AriettaWren	yeah
2016-02-09 07:36:37	AriettaWren	so you're more in favor of the fascist approach
2016-02-09 07:36:48	AriettaWren	of assigning and enforcing places in hierarchy
2016-02-09 07:37:01	%LM22	WHat I want is a level playing field where skill gets you where you are
2016-02-09 07:37:17	AriettaWren	you have that
2016-02-09 07:37:19	AriettaWren	with anarcho capitalism
2016-02-09 07:37:42	AriettaWren	because there's no reason to reject a person capable of producing value
2016-02-09 07:37:43	Blasphammer	anarchy and capitalism? major juxposition
2016-02-09 07:37:53	AriettaWren	and investing in people producing value produces more value
2016-02-09 07:38:10	AriettaWren	so if that third world shithole can be educated to produce higher value things
2016-02-09 07:38:13	AriettaWren	you invest in educating them
2016-02-09 07:38:26	AriettaWren	and they're better off for it
2016-02-09 07:38:32	%LM22	Maybe I'm envisioning a different outcome of anarchist capitalism than you are.
2016-02-09 07:39:02	AriettaWren	the natural outcome would leave anarcho capitalism in favor for any of the failed governmental systems of the past
2016-02-09 07:39:26	AriettaWren	it just makes it not anarcho capitalism anymore
2016-02-09 07:39:48	AriettaWren	that's resolved by the non aggression principle
2016-02-09 07:39:52	%LM22	Which is exactly why a lot of people living in the wild west in America are better off now with statist capitalism than they were back then. 
2016-02-09 07:39:57	%LM22	Makes perfect sense
2016-02-09 07:40:03	%LM22	./s
2016-02-09 07:40:05	AriettaWren	because any of the failed governmental systems of the past require breaking that principle
2016-02-09 07:42:10	%LM22	I have a question for you
2016-02-09 07:42:14	AriettaWren	I think ideally the non aggression principle would be enforced
2016-02-09 07:42:19	AriettaWren	and it'd be the only law of the land
2016-02-09 07:43:24	%LM22	Why do you think states came into existence to begin with? It seems the state and capitalism have ALWAYS existed together. The only examples of stateless capitalism I can think of were extremely violent and generally not good places to live
2016-02-09 07:44:48	AriettaWren	capitalism exists under all conditions
2016-02-09 07:44:54	AriettaWren	states feed off of it
2016-02-09 07:45:04	AriettaWren	states are a parasite to it
2016-02-09 07:47:23	%LM22	Well capitalism in the modern sense didn't exist until after Feudalism. Basically, industrialization led to the landlords losing power as new forms of property came into existence. The state existed before capitalism 
2016-02-09 07:48:46	%LM22	States looked a lot different before capitalism, but they existed 
2016-02-09 07:50:01	AriettaWren	yeah, they were a parasite to people and labor as oppose to a parasite to capitalism and wealth production, it's a blurry line
2016-02-09 07:50:16	AriettaWren	anyway capitalism didn't rise with industrialism
2016-02-09 07:50:25	AriettaWren	it's been around for as long as people have traded things voluntarily
2016-02-09 07:50:49	AriettaWren	for as long as people have assigned value to things and tried to build their personal value in the things they own up
2016-02-09 07:50:55	AriettaWren	through whatever means
2016-02-09 07:51:40	%LM22	I disagree that that is what capitalism is. Capitalism is more than just markets. 
2016-02-09 07:52:52	%LM22	Anyway let's continue this tomorrow. I'm getting sleepy
2016-02-09 07:52:56	AriettaWren	capital has always existed
2016-02-09 07:53:07	AriettaWren	therefor capitalism has always existed
2016-02-09 07:53:16	AriettaWren	*therefore
2016-02-09 07:54:03	%LM22	Goodnight AriettaWren 
2016-02-09 07:54:08	AriettaWren	the dictionary defintion of capitalism is biased and influence by marxist socialist bullshit

2016-02-09 12:22:30	&Lysana	i had that fixed on my version..
2016-02-09 12:22:32	&Segger	So since they don't regen atm, they eventually die :\
2016-02-09 12:22:36	&Lysana	XD
2016-02-09 12:22:45	&Segger	Well I did a pretty big rewrite of a bunch of stuff anyhow
2016-02-09 12:22:47	&Lysana	damn you need a good dot healthcare!
2016-02-09 12:22:54	&Lysana	yeah i'm sure you did
2016-02-09 12:22:55	&Segger	It's not hard to implement, I just haven't gotten to it
2016-02-09 12:23:00	&Segger	I always find new bugz
2016-02-09 12:23:09	&Lysana	I guess so
2016-02-09 12:23:16	&Segger	Or want to add a new feature like the poop sweeping mechanic that's in now :3
2016-02-09 12:23:22	&Lysana	now port it blender and have them be 3D =3
2016-02-09 12:23:53	&Lysana	looks excessive
2016-02-09 12:24:03	&Lysana	you should make them eat each other
2016-02-09 12:24:08	&Lysana	it's a very important feature!

2016-02-09 12:33:00	&Lysana	blender is freaking awesum
2016-02-09 12:33:01	&Segger	With being user friendly maybe

2016-02-09 12:34:25	&Lysana	i remember using it back when i was a baby
2016-02-09 12:34:39	&Segger	don't know anything abt it
2016-02-09 12:34:43	&Lysana	man segger your dots are dying!
2016-02-09 12:34:45	&Segger	I just did a google for low-poly pastel

2016-02-09 12:34:59	&Segger	They don't try hard enough when they're happy is also a problem
2016-02-09 12:35:00	&Lysana	there is only 50% still alive =/
2016-02-09 12:35:05	&Segger	They'll all be dead soon
2016-02-09 12:35:06	&Lysana	and they are dying too
2016-02-09 12:35:09	&Segger	their lives are fleeting
2016-02-09 12:35:13	&Segger	but Lysana 
2016-02-09 12:35:16	&Lysana	and there is food spawned at a location they can't get to
2016-02-09 12:35:19	&Segger	https://sketchfab.com/models/51b879dddd804a9998c422193a75957b this is the post that I found a while back
2016-02-09 12:35:30	&Segger	That made me create a Sketchfab account and download blender
2016-02-09 12:35:35	&Segger	It's such a simple fuckin thing
2016-02-09 12:35:42	&Segger	but I think it's really cute
2016-02-09 12:35:51	&Segger	And want to make things like that to manipulate in a 3d world
2016-02-09 12:35:51	&Segger	maybe
2016-02-09 12:36:07	&Segger	Maybe I'm a digital minimalist
2016-02-09 12:36:15	&Segger	hence my love for pixel art
2016-02-09 12:36:28	&Segger	Or just old and played SNES and Playstation games when I was younger :3
2016-02-09 12:36:47	&Lysana	god it's horrible to see how they are jumping there trying to get food just to starve...
2016-02-09 12:37:12	&Segger	ugh
2016-02-09 12:37:16	&Segger	shuddup
2016-02-09 12:37:17	&Segger	D:
2016-02-09 12:37:27	&Segger	I'll have to make it so they have random names
2016-02-09 12:37:30	&Lysana	yeah that raspberry is just what they need
2016-02-09 12:37:35	&Lysana	infinite nutrition!
2016-02-09 12:37:38	&Segger	That way you can feel really bad when they're desparate and dying
2016-02-09 12:37:42	&Lysana	Why give them names?!
2016-02-09 12:37:51	&Lysana	that makes it so much worse
2016-02-09 12:37:54	&Segger	:V
2016-02-09 12:37:58	&Lysana	you should rather make it that you can name them XD
2016-02-09 12:38:06	&Lysana	poopturd#3 died =3
2016-02-09 12:38:07	&Segger	hm

2016-02-09 12:38:19	&Segger	The problem with that is getting a text input box in canvas
2016-02-09 12:38:20	&Lysana	poopturd#3 is hungry.
2016-02-09 12:38:25	&Segger	I'd have to make a floating div with a text entry thing
2016-02-09 12:38:29	&Lysana	poopturd#3 hasn't eaten for over a minute now!
2016-02-09 12:38:36	&Segger	oh lol shutup

2016-02-09 12:39:33	&Lysana	poopturd#3 is sad and needs pets.
2016-02-09 12:39:33	&Segger	I was thinking of making a status thing, that writes text to it
2016-02-09 12:39:35	&Segger	But I dunno
2016-02-09 12:40:01	&Lysana	poopturd#3 has evolved into Sweggler.

2016-02-09 14:32:30	&Segger	Lysana, I was thinking about that, but having each one of them iterate over all of the poops every frame to check if they are near many of of them would be super intensive
2016-02-09 14:32:32	&Segger	and not worth it
2016-02-09 14:32:37	--	mom is now known as boamster
2016-02-09 14:32:39	&Segger	I'll just let them embrace their own shit
2016-02-09 14:33:11	&Lysana	you could use a better datastructure

2016-02-11 22:32:51	Reladhi	well hey, if i can learn a new recipe while i mess with someone, that's great. cooking is fun just like annoying wise mexicans
2016-02-11 22:33:46	&Segger	ChubbyChaser, obvs the novelty of cooking based on a recipe from someone you met on the internet is much more valuable than lookin it up
2016-02-11 22:35:03	Reladhi	ChubbyChased due to my ignorance of how mexican food is cooked you could mess with me and tell me to cook it the wrong way :P
2016-02-11 22:35:18	Reladhi	but pls don't. i actually want to cook it :P:P

2016-02-12 17:02:42	Rimu	the funniest part about suicide is
2016-02-12 17:02:48	Rimu	when you get bad letters from debt collectors
2016-02-12 17:02:52	Rimu	"pls pay the debt of your dead son"
2016-02-12 17:02:59	Rimu	"pay now or we'll fuck you up"

2016-02-12 17:04:28	Rimu	never had the luck to meet a debt collector
2016-02-12 17:04:49	Sir_N	why
2016-02-12 17:04:49	Rimu	i do got letters saying i have to pay shit but
2016-02-12 17:04:50	Rimu	who cares
2016-02-12 17:05:01	Sir_N	yeah
2016-02-12 17:05:04	Rimu	even though our laws are pretty shit when it comes to debt
2016-02-12 17:05:16	Rimu	we've got different Scoringsystems, they just blacklist you, so your scores are getting downhill
2016-02-12 17:05:29	Rimu	and these scores are needed in order to get a credit, opening up a new bank account or just renting a house
2016-02-12 17:05:34	Rimu	if your score is shit they wont give you shit too
2016-02-12 17:05:45	Sir_N	shit
2016-02-12 17:05:53	Rimu	then they just send "evidences" of your debt to the next court, and then they just list you with a "title"
2016-02-12 17:06:04	Rimu	this means they are able to pawn your stuff, and withdraw money from your account
2016-02-12 17:06:10	Rimu	until your debt is paid
2016-02-12 17:07:14	Rimu	in cases of high debt where you wouldn't be able to pay them no matter how hard you work
2016-02-12 17:07:22	Rimu	you can apply for a "private bankruptcy"
2016-02-12 17:07:48	Rimu	this means, you have to write to all the people you owe money, then you have to head to the court and fill out paper, then for 3 years you have to follow strict rules
2016-02-12 17:08:00	Rimu	you pay monthly, everyone, but its up to the court to decide how much you pay then
2016-02-12 17:08:07	Rimu	you aren't allowed to make any new debt
2016-02-12 17:08:18	Rimu	if you buy a house, or get money from relatives, even if you just use someone elses car
2016-02-12 17:08:21	Rimu	you have to inform them
2016-02-12 17:08:26	Rimu	after 3 years, you are debtfree 
2016-02-12 17:08:42	Rimu	you'll get a letter with the sentence, no matter how much you've paid to the people
2016-02-12 17:08:45	Rimu	lawwise you are now debtfree
2016-02-12 17:09:03	Rimu	if you were in debt by 1 million and you just paid off 0,0078% in the meantime, you are debtfree
2016-02-12 17:09:18	Sir_N	wew that's cool
2016-02-12 17:13:53	Rimu	its meant for people who are in debt and would die out of starvation
2016-02-12 17:13:56	Rimu	though, you can abuse it
2016-02-12 17:14:08	Rimu	you can build up a company, you can ruin it 
2016-02-12 17:14:22	Rimu	but all the profit you've made just gets transfered on different bank accounts 
2016-02-12 17:14:25	Rimu	of course, outside Europe
2016-02-12 17:14:30	Rimu	then you just head to the court, fill out papers
2016-02-12 17:14:35	Rimu	and do the poorfag for 3 years
2016-02-12 17:14:45	Rimu	afterwards you aare debtfree, your money is yours and there is no way to take it away from you

2016-02-14 21:11:46	ChubbyChased	nadir: i haven't been much active here so i don't know much about the whole situation...

2016-02-14 21:12:48	nadir	That's exactly what hearsay means.
2016-02-14 21:13:04	ChubbyChased	nope
2016-02-14 21:13:10	&Segger	Why are you complaining about dishing out bans when ChubbyChased just removed it
2016-02-14 21:13:46	nadir	Because the civilian casualties haven't been compensated
2016-02-14 21:14:01	ChubbyChased	nadir: masking you identity is pretty easy by just using another client
2016-02-14 21:14:07	nadir	Hearsay - information received from other people that one cannot adequately substantiate
2016-02-14 21:14:20	nadir	2.) the report of another person's words by a witness, usually disallowed as evidence in a court of law.
2016-02-14 21:14:31	ChubbyChased	for example, if i used kiwiirc and wanted to evade a lame ban (like the ones we use lol), i'd just use mibbit
2016-02-14 21:14:49	Rimu	so is arietta actually a mastertroll?
2016-02-14 21:15:01	nadir	If you use kiwi OR mibbit, you fail automatically
2016-02-14 21:15:17	ChubbyChased	if he were a mastertroll he wouldn't tell he's arietta with another nick tho 
2016-02-14 21:15:33	ChubbyChased	nadir: people don't want to download other irc clients just to evade bans
2016-02-14 21:15:33	Rimu	but that might be part of his plan
2016-02-14 21:15:45	ChubbyChased	well, that's a posibility 
2016-02-14 21:15:48	nadir	You don't have to.

2016-02-15 18:13:21	Rimu	serves me well
2016-02-15 18:13:27	Rimu	but i thought about replacing it with a macbook air
2016-02-15 18:13:36	Rimu	though, a new macbook air is too expensive, and a used one too
2016-02-15 18:13:51	ChubbyChased	jesus christ, why?
2016-02-15 18:14:08	Rimu	its small its quiet
2016-02-15 18:14:13	Rimu	only reason
2016-02-15 18:14:16	Rimu	but its just too expensive
2016-02-15 18:14:32	Rimu	last time i checked for used macbook airs, the cheapest i found was 600 bucks for a 2011 version
2016-02-15 18:14:37	Rimu	this fucking device is over 5 years old
2016-02-15 18:14:41	Rimu	not even worth it
2016-02-15 18:14:51	Rimu	compared to new prices i could get a current one for 900 bucks
2016-02-15 18:14:59	Rimu	see the relation, its fucking insane what people want
2016-02-15 18:15:09	Rimu	thats why i went with a tiny samsung
2016-02-15 18:15:14	Rimu	bought it used from amazon for 150 bucks
2016-02-15 18:15:29	Rimu	just bought a Samsung SSD too, and some more ram, in total i paid under 250 bucks
2016-02-15 18:15:38	Rimu	and it serves me well, only downside: its kinda loud

2016-02-17 15:46:00	Napstablook	How are you doing Segger?
2016-02-17 15:46:04	&Segger	im good
2016-02-17 15:46:08	&Segger	playin some Fire Red right now
2016-02-17 15:46:12	Napstablook	that sounds wonderful. 
2016-02-17 15:46:16	&Segger	yeah man
2016-02-17 15:46:24	&Segger	It's goin pretty well
2016-02-17 15:46:31	Napstablook	I really wish I could play.
2016-02-17 15:46:50	Napstablook	but it is pointless to me now, I really don't think I could learn anything from pok?mon now
2016-02-17 15:47:06	&Segger	Well I'm not really playin to learn stuff
2016-02-17 15:47:14	&Segger	Although I am still learning about the fighting system
2016-02-17 15:47:20	&Lysana	Lol
2016-02-17 15:47:21	&Segger	pokemon stat management is pretty fuggn complex
2016-02-17 15:47:27	Napstablook	what are you learning about? oh it is not
2016-02-17 15:47:28	&Segger	EV training and whatnot
2016-02-17 15:47:34	&Segger	It totes is
2016-02-17 15:47:35	Napstablook	ev training is not complex.
2016-02-17 15:47:46	&Segger	It's pretty complex when it comes to raising them and stuff
2016-02-17 15:47:54	&Segger	And getting moves from one pokemon to another
2016-02-17 15:47:58	Napstablook	Considering every single pokemon, regardless of level, provides the same evs' 
2016-02-17 15:48:02	&Segger	That wouldn't normally get them without breeding
2016-02-17 15:48:18	Napstablook	You just fight an amount of pokemon to raise a certain stat before rare-candy into next level
2016-02-17 15:48:20	Napstablook	or boxing them
2016-02-17 15:48:56	Napstablook	Move chains are a bit difficult but not complex, essentially you need to look one level up into moves that the mother learns.
2016-02-17 15:49:16	&Segger	one thing I'm considering doing is getting a pokemon from fire red that I actually like
2016-02-17 15:49:31	&Segger	and trading it to my pc with a DS emulator or something
2016-02-17 15:49:39	Napstablook	what pok?mon is that?
2016-02-17 15:49:41	&Segger	And making some sort of project with the code for that pokemon :3
2016-02-17 15:49:44	&Segger	Not sure yet
2016-02-17 15:49:54	&Segger	Maybe a porygon or something
2016-02-17 15:49:57	&Segger	they're cool
2016-02-17 15:50:11	Napstablook	Porygon, I remember having a Porygon on gen 1
2016-02-17 15:50:18	&Segger	Yeah
2016-02-17 15:50:20	Napstablook	it was a bit overpowered thanks to conversion.
2016-02-17 15:50:25	&Segger	I might try and get one in the game corner
2016-02-17 15:50:31	&Segger	Without just paying for the coins
2016-02-17 15:50:44	&Segger	I haven't gotten there yet though
2016-02-17 15:50:50	Napstablook	o_o
2016-02-17 15:51:08	Napstablook	ok... I just remember my training days (2 gen)
2016-02-17 15:51:20	&Segger	Yeah gen 2 is my fave
2016-02-17 15:51:21	Napstablook	where I would grab a new cartridge and finish the game on 5 or so hours
2016-02-17 15:51:33	&Segger	I wish soul silver and heart gold came out on GBA instead
2016-02-17 15:51:36	Napstablook	and then get into egg breeding with a batch from another cartridge.

2016-02-17 17:01:12	AriettaWren	for the stuff they produce when you feed them
2016-02-17 17:01:21	AriettaWren	that goes up and down
2016-02-17 17:01:29	AriettaWren	so there's value in all slimes
2016-02-17 17:01:30	tj	yea it sounds a lot like a minigame in certain game i know
2016-02-17 17:01:31	AriettaWren	mixed or pure
2016-02-17 17:01:42	tj	im not sure if this game copied the entire concept or it was already made before
2016-02-17 17:01:58	tj	it sounds too simple really but i had never seen it before
2016-02-17 17:02:00	AriettaWren	I found it from this video https://youtu.be/yX81xwoq-Rg

2016-02-17 17:07:28	AriettaWren	you have to feed them different things and keep them alive
2016-02-17 17:07:57	AriettaWren	like my cat slimes I only have 6 because the chicken coop I have can only keep that many happy
2016-02-17 17:08:16	AriettaWren	but pink slimes eat fruits/vegetables and they're easier to get so I have 20
2016-02-17 17:08:58	AriettaWren	so you just have to get a feel for what you can sustain and min/max your profits
2016-02-17 17:10:10	AriettaWren	different slimes have to be contained in different ways, some can fly out, some can jump out, some stack on eachother to try to get out
2016-02-17 17:10:52	AriettaWren	there's a fuck you slime type that destroys everything
2016-02-17 17:11:08	AriettaWren	and duplicates itself
2016-02-17 17:11:43	AriettaWren	and natural ecosystems outside of your ranch
2016-02-17 17:12:31	AriettaWren	that have slimes developing and interacting independent of you

2016-02-18 01:10:53	RedSki	AriettaWren: In general or currently?
2016-02-18 01:11:03	AriettaWren	both
2016-02-18 01:11:12	RedSki	uh
2016-02-18 01:11:21	RedSki	I guess it's kind of a loaded question
2016-02-18 01:11:52	RedSki	Not sure how I should answer it without rambling for ages
2016-02-18 01:13:09	AriettaWren	you can talk for as long as you need
2016-02-18 01:13:21	RedSki	Alright, cool I guess
2016-02-18 01:14:27	RedSki	I suppose the depression mainly stems from it just being me on my own and feeling fucked
2016-02-18 01:14:40	RedSki	A lot of shit happened last year
2016-02-18 01:14:43	RedSki	:I
2016-02-18 01:15:36	AriettaWren	what about last year is bothering you now?
2016-02-18 01:15:43	boston_paul	AriettaWren, come to #aidf
2016-02-18 01:16:06	AriettaWren	no thanks
2016-02-18 01:16:11	RedSki	AriettaWren: Uh...
2016-02-18 01:16:46	RedSki	Last year I became homeless shortly after I turned 19 because I had to get away from family
2016-02-18 01:17:01	RedSki	That I no longer talk to
2016-02-18 01:17:06	RedSki	Not homeless anymore though
2016-02-18 01:17:13	RedSki	Uh what else
2016-02-18 01:17:48	RedSki	I had an operation on my chest in April that involved having all of my rib bones sawed through, that was fun
2016-02-18 01:18:10	RedSki	Ended up caked off my mind on meds and could barely think, plus I was pretty much incapacitated
2016-02-18 01:18:22	RedSki	All of this happened while I was homeless/living in a hostel 
2016-02-18 01:19:23	RedSki	Just...a lot of annoying crap I guess
2016-02-18 01:20:17	AriettaWren	damn. not homeless anymore so that's good isn't it?
2016-02-18 01:20:26	AriettaWren	how'd you recover?
2016-02-18 01:20:31	ChubbyChaser	Man...
2016-02-18 01:20:52	RedSki	AriettaWren: I spent 9 months being a cripple, basically
2016-02-18 01:20:55	ChubbyChaser	Why did you have an operation? If you want to tell us, course 
2016-02-18 01:20:55	RedSki	And in a loooot of pain
2016-02-18 01:21:04	RedSki	ChubbyChaser: To correct a defect
2016-02-18 01:21:21	ChubbyChaser	A cardiac effect? 
2016-02-18 01:21:29	AriettaWren	RedSki, I mean from homelessness
2016-02-18 01:21:43	RedSki	Oh
2016-02-18 01:21:47	AriettaWren	that's pretty impressive imo
2016-02-18 01:22:01	AriettaWren	to have been  homeless, dealing with all that, and not be anymore
2016-02-18 01:22:01	RedSki	I left the hostel after finding a room to rent in a shared house
2016-02-18 01:22:35	RedSki	But the guy who owned it is selling it soon so
2016-02-18 01:22:35	AriettaWren	I see
2016-02-18 01:22:45	RedSki	Time to find somewhere else
2016-02-18 01:22:47	AriettaWren	looking for another place now?
2016-02-18 01:22:57	RedSki	I should be lol

2016-02-18 01:23:31	RedSki	I dunno
2016-02-18 01:23:39	RedSki	I need to get of my arse and sort money out
2016-02-18 01:24:27	RedSki	I had a voluntary job during my recovery period for my chest at least
2016-02-18 01:24:35	RedSki	Probably the only thing that kept me sane during it
2016-02-18 01:25:31	RedSki	It doesn't help that I'm a shut in and never go outside
2016-02-18 01:25:34	AriettaWren	I'm 20 and neet, I need to do the same thing in terms of money
2016-02-18 01:25:45	AriettaWren	I'm the same
2016-02-18 01:25:51	RedSki	yep
2016-02-18 01:26:17	RedSki	I'm not even on cripplebux anymore after I couldn't turn up to a medical assessment
2016-02-18 01:26:32	RedSki	due to being in pain/depressed/semi-incapacitated o-o

2016-02-18 02:15:48	ChubbyChased	ohhh yeah lol
2016-02-18 02:15:54	ChubbyChased	when my update manager was fugged up
2016-02-18 02:16:15	ChubbyChased	well, i'm still on my way of learning
2016-02-18 02:16:35	ChubbyChased	i installed debian on an old desktop and i want a thinkpad to install gentoo on it
2016-02-18 02:16:43	ChubbyChased	i'll keep xubuntu or mint on my main laptop tho

2016-02-18 02:17:27	&Segger	I've never really set up a gentoo install so mrep.
2016-02-18 02:18:14	ChubbyChased	i tried installing arch on my main laptop like 5 times, then tried it on a VM like 10 times but fucked it up
2016-02-18 02:18:21	ChubbyChased	even when i was following a fucking youtube video
2016-02-18 02:18:24	&Segger	lol
2016-02-18 02:18:41	&Segger	Yeah arch is a pain now, they used to include a cute lil install script to streamline the process
2016-02-18 02:18:44	&Segger	but now it's dumb
2016-02-18 02:18:51	ChubbyChased	so i'll better learn what the fuck i am doing instead of imitating  some guy's instructions like a monkey
2016-02-18 02:19:08	&Segger	You can find install scripts online though
2016-02-18 02:19:34	&Segger	I tried one once on vbox and it still didnt work though

2016-02-18 02:22:03	ChubbyChased	even when i don't know how to change the keyboard language to type that little upwards meme arrow to make an epin shitposting face

2016-02-18 02:28:20	ChubbyChased	because she didn't have a fax machine

2016-02-18 02:50:32	migraine	 Sometimes I wonder about how it would feel to be dead and I imagine it like the 2 seconds when you wake up after a nice long sleep and completely forget about everything. I smile when I think about this just an everlasting peace and serenity, but then I think about situations in which I just last in a purgatory state where I just observe the world for an eternity, and I worry about my life.

2016-02-19 09:05:49	tj	well i think it's true that hope is the last thing we lose, it makes sense after all.
2016-02-19 09:05:57	tj	we all have hopes of it getting better at some point.
2016-02-19 09:06:04	tj	if we didn't, we'd all be dead already.
2016-02-19 09:06:15	tj	so that is why we continue to struggle.
2016-02-19 09:06:29	tj	for that glimmer of hope that tells us everyday, it's going to get better.
2016-02-19 09:06:33	tj	but obviously you have to work for it.
2016-02-19 09:07:46	tj	we need to grab onto anything we have if it means staying alive.
2016-02-19 09:07:49	tj	it's human nature.
2016-02-19 09:08:18	tj	So find a reason to live, besides simply not wanting to die.
2016-02-19 09:08:51	bym	I don't think I'll get better, because I really don't know what that'd be. It's like I'm in a constant race towards this ephemeral and unachievable idea of normality
2016-02-19 09:11:46	tj	are you staying alive for someone else then?
2016-02-19 09:12:31	bym	Nope
2016-02-19 09:12:47	tj	So why are you still alive?

2016-02-19 09:15:57	AnimeWatcherNewbie	for me staying alive is a BAD idea.

2016-02-19 09:19:28	tj	you seem smart enough to realize that.
2016-02-19 09:19:33	tj	so why are you still alive?
2016-02-19 09:19:46	AnimeWatcherNewbie	I didn't do the smart thing.

2016-02-19 09:22:25	AnimeWatcherNewbie	you heard me
2016-02-19 09:22:29	tj	but you're not killing anyone
2016-02-19 09:22:48	AnimeWatcherNewbie	thinking about doing it, and doing it are two completely different things.
2016-02-19 09:22:59	tj	exactly...
2016-02-19 09:23:03	tj	so why compare yourself to them?
2016-02-19 09:23:17	sparrow	what makes you think about doing it, AWN?
2016-02-19 09:23:25	AnimeWatcherNewbie	because both need to be eliminated from exsistance.
2016-02-19 09:23:32	tj	sigh
2016-02-19 09:23:53	AnimeWatcherNewbie	tj, I see suicide differently than most people
2016-02-19 09:24:06	AnimeWatcherNewbie	most people think it's a way out.
2016-02-19 09:24:28	AnimeWatcherNewbie	I see it more as a safety precaution to prevent myself from doing something more drastic
2016-02-19 09:24:36	tj	so
2016-02-19 09:24:41	tj	have you been diagnosed with something
2016-02-19 09:24:54	AnimeWatcherNewbie	yeah, long time ago
2016-02-19 09:24:54	tj	lots of autists around here
2016-02-19 09:24:57	tj	pretty harmless though
2016-02-19 09:25:04	AnimeWatcherNewbie	autism IS harmless.
2016-02-19 09:25:23	AnimeWatcherNewbie	but not when you have depression and schizophrenia along with it
2016-02-19 09:26:15	AnimeWatcherNewbie	I like to think of myself as one step below people who have a short fuse.
2016-02-19 09:26:37	AnimeWatcherNewbie	I can litteraly turn mad on a pin drop
2016-02-19 09:26:47	tj	ever hurted someone before?
2016-02-19 09:26:49	SHEKEL_OS[PsyD]	When you're a psychopath like me, you are immune to depression and autisms
2016-02-19 09:27:07	AriettaWren	SHEKEL_OS[PsyD], are you really a psychopath?
2016-02-19 09:27:18	tj	probably not
2016-02-19 09:27:20	tj	he's a troll
2016-02-19 09:27:21	AnimeWatcherNewbie	tj, again, thinking about it and acting on it are two different things.
2016-02-19 09:27:35	AriettaWren	tj, I'm familiar
2016-02-19 09:27:44	SHEKEL_OS[PsyD]	AriettaWren nah, I'm just mildly clairvoyant
2016-02-19 09:27:50	AriettaWren	SHEKEL_OS[PsyD], lol
2016-02-19 09:27:55	tj	AnimeWatcherNewbie: so if you haven't hurt anyone before in your life what makes you think it will happen?
2016-02-19 09:28:01	AnimeWatcherNewbie	I've been having these thoughts for... 16 years.
2016-02-19 09:28:07	tj	Thinking about it and doing it are two different things
2016-02-19 09:28:12	tj	you think it might happen
2016-02-19 09:28:15	tj	but would it actually happen?
2016-02-19 09:28:16	AnimeWatcherNewbie	yes.
2016-02-19 09:28:28	SHEKEL_OS[PsyD]	Genghis Khan was clairvoyant too
2016-02-19 09:28:36	AnimeWatcherNewbie	No, because I'm too dumb to go through with it
2016-02-19 09:28:39	SHEKEL_OS[PsyD]	That is why they wanted his ass dead as a baby
2016-02-19 09:28:44	tj	So what the fuck are you afraid of.
2016-02-19 09:28:52	tj	It's not going to happen.
2016-02-19 09:28:55	SHEKEL_OS[PsyD]	Shut up tj
2016-02-19 09:28:58	tj	you won't kill anyone besides you
2016-02-19 09:28:59	SHEKEL_OS[PsyD]	Just shut up
2016-02-19 09:28:59	AnimeWatcherNewbie	not being taken seriously.
2016-02-19 09:29:08	SHEKEL_OS[PsyD]	I can kill with ease
2016-02-19 09:29:09	AnimeWatcherNewbie	I need to be killed.
2016-02-19 09:29:10	tj	What does that even mean?
2016-02-19 09:29:28	tj	and you still haven't really told me what's keeping you from doing it
2016-02-19 09:29:32	tj	besides "i should have done it before"
2016-02-19 09:29:40	tj	that's not a reason for why you're not doing it right now.
2016-02-19 09:29:41	AnimeWatcherNewbie	tj, stupidity.
2016-02-19 09:29:42	SHEKEL_OS[PsyD]	The problem is I would never kill myself

2016-02-19 09:41:05	AriettaWren	if you want to beat her senseless
2016-02-19 09:42:34	AnimeWatcherNewbie	I'm not sure, maybe I don't think it's severe enough
2016-02-19 09:42:42	AnimeWatcherNewbie	right now it's just thoughts
2016-02-19 09:42:58	AnimeWatcherNewbie	but acting on them, that's a whole different ball game.

2016-02-19 19:33:37	Shekel_OS	Thusly, the whites have a titanic amount of debt
2016-02-19 19:33:46	Shekel_OS	Because they paid for horse lives with beads
2016-02-19 19:35:18	Shekel_OS	They thought vietnam was easy pickins because they didn't have horses

2016-02-19 20:28:24	figaro	ascoeur, cause some people who are suicidals don't really want to kill themselves persay they just want a solution to a problem 
2016-02-19 20:28:35	ascoeur	its not about whether its cowardly, maybe it is, who cares, theres nothing wrong with being a coward, why do we need to pressure people into tortuting themselves by existing
2016-02-19 20:29:13	ascoeur	figaro: well its more fucked up then when you consider there usually arent solutions except "deal with it"
2016-02-19 20:29:24	figaro	ascoeur, uh no?

2016-02-21 11:56:25	japex	she got up, got dressed, drove off without telling me where she was going
2016-02-21 11:56:26	AriettaWren	DanGan_OS[PsyD], lol
2016-02-21 11:56:34	japex	leaving me stranded in her house which is in the middle of nowhere during a thunder storm

2016-02-21 11:57:22	DanGan_OS[PsyD]	I wish I had such adventures with my girlfriends
2016-02-21 11:57:27	DanGan_OS[PsyD]	All my girlfriends were boring
2016-02-21 11:57:30	japex	So I started a fight with her.

2016-02-21 11:57:34	DanGan_OS[PsyD]	Except my first
2016-02-21 11:57:37	japex	I questioned her and accused her of being a slut.
2016-02-21 11:57:48	japex	First off, she's afraid to drive. She won't drive anywhere 99.9% of the time unless her sister is in the car
2016-02-21 11:57:53	japex	so that set me off
2016-02-21 11:57:55	DanGan_OS[PsyD]	I feel like I was comparing all of the girls after her to her
2016-02-21 11:58:04	DanGan_OS[PsyD]	And that was turning me off from a lot of hotties
2016-02-21 11:58:07	japex	brb shit
2016-02-21 11:58:26	goatse911	Self time outs are healthy in a relationship, japex
2016-02-21 11:58:47	goatse911	I hope he means literal shit and not his gf standing from behind him lol

2016-02-21 12:00:29	goatse911	most likely, but dorks should still respect each other... lol, you can't assume every time she leaves she is going to be a slut.
2016-02-21 12:00:36	goatse911	that is the definition of controlling
2016-02-21 12:01:48	goatse911	moch, I will need further details
2016-02-21 12:04:30	japex	Yeah, but she was afraid to drive
2016-02-21 12:04:38	japex	And she drove off and was gone for two hours
2016-02-21 12:04:41	japex	when she has no friends
2016-02-21 12:04:47	japex	and her sister lives 4 hours away.
2016-02-21 12:04:58	japex	That's the only relative she has in that area too.
2016-02-21 12:05:25	japex	A week prior she told me she was having camsex with a local black dude after I told her I was on Tinychat w/ people from IRC

2016-02-21 12:43:41	AriettaWren	ah
2016-02-21 12:43:42	japex	*policy
2016-02-21 12:43:48	AriettaWren	I see
2016-02-21 12:43:54	japex	Well, it's risky and I don't think I want to spend 25 years of my life in prison
2016-02-21 12:43:55	AriettaWren	lucky
2016-02-21 12:44:05	japex	Most of my money I've been spending on food
2016-02-21 12:44:18	japex	I bought a car while I was in Houston. my unclce insisted i lrn 2 drive or he'd kick me out
2016-02-21 12:44:27	japex	he'd also get drunk af. he's like 5'9 310 pounds of muscle
2016-02-21 12:44:36	japex	ex-convict murderer/rapist
2016-02-21 12:44:57	moch	id have a panic attack
2016-02-21 12:44:58	japex	He'd get pissed and make me walk w/ him @ wee hours in the morning where he'd just repeat himself
2016-02-21 12:45:01	moch	im afraid of people
2016-02-21 12:45:16	japex	He'd yell @ his new wife it was really dysfunctional and reminded me of my childhood
2016-02-21 12:45:21	AriettaWren	japex, why are you so scared of your own place?
2016-02-21 12:45:27	AriettaWren	why are you so scared of driving?
2016-02-21 12:45:39	japex	i can't remember the stuff i need to in order to pass the driver's exam
2016-02-21 12:45:40	AriettaWren	have you talked with a therapist about your fears?
2016-02-21 12:45:44	japex	the written part will fuck me
2016-02-21 12:45:45	moch	i dont drive either
2016-02-21 12:45:46	AriettaWren	are you seeing a therapist now?
2016-02-21 12:45:53	japex	nah i haven't seen a therapist since i was 16
2016-02-21 12:45:56	AriettaWren	japex, is that an assumption or have you already tried
2016-02-21 12:46:05	japex	an assumption because i can't remember the facts
2016-02-21 12:46:09	AriettaWren	I think you should see a therapist and make a point to talk about your problems and resolving them
2016-02-21 12:46:20	japex	i'm considering trying modafinil
2016-02-21 12:46:30	japex	and maybe a piracetam stack
2016-02-21 12:46:49	japex	My paranoia is mostly in check. occasionally i feel like the government is manipulating me
2016-02-21 12:47:02	japex	and trying to turn me into a spree shooter with a believable history so they can sell the case to the media
2016-02-21 12:47:11	AriettaWren	lol
2016-02-21 12:47:24	AriettaWren	I think you need to talk to a professional
2016-02-21 12:47:28	AriettaWren	and you seem unwilling to
2016-02-21 12:47:29	AriettaWren	why?
2016-02-21 12:47:40	AriettaWren	do you not want to get better?
2016-02-21 12:47:42	japex	I've debated it. professionals were known to manipulate patients while working
2016-02-21 12:47:46	japex	on MK-ULTRA subproject
2016-02-21 12:47:47	japex	s
2016-02-21 12:47:58	japex	people that are really mentally ill never get better. modern medicine is ineffective
2016-02-21 12:48:24	AriettaWren	I think you're being pretty stupid
2016-02-21 12:48:27	japex	there's no incentive for pharma companies to actually make good meds to help people because what they have going for them now is too profitable
2016-02-21 12:48:30	AriettaWren	saying things like never
2016-02-21 12:48:44	japex	last time i took medicine (zoloft) my girlfriend at the time told me to just kill myself
2016-02-21 12:48:49	japex	so i took like 20 zoloft
2016-02-21 12:48:52	japex	20 advil
2016-02-21 12:48:55	AriettaWren	japex, if what they were selling wasn't working, people wouldn't buy
2016-02-21 12:49:07	japex	and a buncha of trazodone
2016-02-21 12:49:15	AriettaWren	you could argue for forced sustained use
2016-02-21 12:49:18	japex	they didn't pump my stomach or give me any charcoal
2016-02-21 12:49:21	AriettaWren	but if it had no effect, it wouldn't sell
2016-02-21 12:49:27	japex	i had intense neuroeopathic pain for a week where i was unable to move
2016-02-21 12:49:34	AriettaWren	anyway, either way, what you're doing now isn't working
2016-02-21 12:49:40	AriettaWren	and you will die alone if you keep it up
2016-02-21 12:49:51	japex	I felt like I was doing okay earlier, but lately i just get really really dumb
2016-02-21 12:49:57	japex	sort of like how i was as a kid
2016-02-21 12:50:09	japex	and words all lose their meaning
2016-02-21 12:50:15	wszed?	nadir (~ZNadir@94933DB0.9B7B2CAA.662CFB74.IP) has joined #depression
2016-02-21 12:50:21	AriettaWren	you don't sound dumb, in terms of vocabulary, sentence structure, etc.
2016-02-21 12:50:26	japex	My perception of time is heavily distorted too. Sometimes I lose weeks at a time.
2016-02-21 12:50:36	japex	Tonight I'm doing better than I have been
2016-02-21 12:50:37	AriettaWren	you're saying some dumb things, making some broad assumptions and sweeping generalizations
2016-02-21 12:50:49	japex	I was caught up on using 'but' and 'if' in every sentence
2016-02-21 12:50:50	japex	Now it's and
2016-02-21 12:50:56	AriettaWren	your perception of time isn't the only thing that's distorted
2016-02-21 12:50:57	japex	plus I'm talking about myself. One of the few things I'm good at doing
2016-02-21 12:51:24	AriettaWren	why don't you take you being good at talking about yourself to a therapist and let them help you?
2016-02-21 12:51:31	AriettaWren	your family is fucked, you're not going to get anything there
2016-02-21 12:51:43	japex	when I awlk into their office all these thoughts seem to disappaer. mymind goes blank
2016-02-21 12:51:43	AriettaWren	you're not going to find anything in a relationship in the sense you'll only attract similar people
2016-02-21 12:51:53	AriettaWren	japex, would writing help?
2016-02-21 12:52:04	japex	I tried to save all my forum posts, irc chat logs and stuff
2016-02-21 12:52:09	japex	to show a therapist, but i troll sometimes too 
2016-02-21 12:52:10	AriettaWren	get the thoughts together before you go in
2016-02-21 12:52:27	japex	and i already had one therapist have me locked away for threatening to shoot up a school (sarcastically)
2016-02-21 12:52:48	AriettaWren	be wary of that sort of thing
2016-02-21 12:52:52	japex	i was institutionalized 4 times overall
2016-02-21 12:52:59	AriettaWren	you know why
2016-02-21 12:53:05	japex	Each time I refused any medication and the staff thought I was a good kid.
2016-02-21 12:53:09	japex	They liked me and gave me special privileges
2016-02-21 12:53:15	japex	I'd talk w/ them about their life, job, etc
2016-02-21 12:53:21	AriettaWren	japex, 
2016-02-21 12:53:23	japex	we'd discuss other patients
2016-02-21 12:53:30	AriettaWren	that didn't help at all
2016-02-21 12:53:30	japex	sup?
2016-02-21 12:53:48	japex	yeah. it didn't, but it got me out of those places quickly
2016-02-21 12:54:16	japex	I'd have nightmares about being institutionalized
2016-02-21 12:54:28	AriettaWren	don't be
2016-02-21 12:54:33	AriettaWren	don't say thing that'd make you be
2016-02-21 12:54:34	japex	My dad has spent his entire life in and out of hospitals and homeless
2016-02-21 12:54:38	AriettaWren	you obviously don't and haven't done things
2016-02-21 12:54:52	AriettaWren	it's just stuff you say
2016-02-21 12:54:57	japex	eh, ive done plenty of bad shit. i mean i tried killing myself, i had my ex girlfriends hurt themselves
2016-02-21 12:54:57	AriettaWren	you can talk about yourself and your problems
2016-02-21 12:55:00	AriettaWren	by themselves
2016-02-21 12:55:01	japex	to prove themsevles to me
2016-02-21 12:55:10	japex	i humilate and emotionally abuse ppl for fun
2016-02-21 12:55:16	AriettaWren	talk about it
2016-02-21 12:55:18	japex	to make myself feel capable & to laugh
2016-02-21 12:55:30	AriettaWren	replace that behavior with something less damaging/more productive
2016-02-21 12:55:37	japex	I tried learning chemistry
2016-02-21 12:55:44	japex	calc.
2016-02-21 12:55:50	japex	C & assembly
2016-02-21 12:55:53	japex	but I can't remember
2016-02-21 12:55:55	AriettaWren	something fun
2016-02-21 12:55:59	AriettaWren	silly
2016-02-21 12:56:06	AriettaWren	a hobby
2016-02-21 12:56:16	japex	My current hobby is playing DoTA 2 and blogging on IRC
2016-02-21 12:56:20	japex	i fail miserably @ both
2016-02-21 12:56:21	japex	lol
2016-02-21 12:56:24	AriettaWren	cute
2016-02-21 12:56:37	AriettaWren	I play guitar :p https://a.pomf.cat/timlfe.mp3
2016-02-21 12:56:47	AriettaWren	I'm 20 and I'm not doing much better, but I'm not hurting people or myself
2016-02-21 12:57:05	AriettaWren	we've talked before
2016-02-21 12:57:11	AriettaWren	when I was rincewind, I don't know if you remember
2016-02-21 12:57:16	japex	ya :3
2016-02-21 12:57:30	AriettaWren	what do you think of my latest recording?
2016-02-21 12:57:32	AriettaWren	it's a duet
2016-02-21 12:57:34	japex	pretty impressive
2016-02-21 12:57:44	japex	i like the bass guitar, but i struggle to really understand music
2016-02-21 12:57:55	AriettaWren	thanks
2016-02-21 12:57:58	japex	in the 4th grade i tried learning to play violin, but i couldn't read the sheets
2016-02-21 12:58:00	AriettaWren	I learned in school band
2016-02-21 12:58:12	AriettaWren	and had some guitar lessons starting out
2016-02-21 12:58:28	AriettaWren	with guitar, in band I played alto sax which is where I got familiar with reading music
2016-02-21 12:58:36	AriettaWren	but it's not difficult at all
2016-02-21 12:58:48	AriettaWren	I've devolved though
2016-02-21 12:58:53	AriettaWren	to just reading tabs over sheet music
2016-02-21 12:59:14	AriettaWren	they make so much more sense for guitar
2016-02-21 12:59:37	japex	You've got to have great hand cordination
2016-02-21 12:59:40	japex	to strum strings well
2016-02-21 12:59:42	AriettaWren	this is my soundcloud https://soundcloud.com/dont-read-this-814362960
2016-02-21 12:59:59	AriettaWren	I think you develop it
2016-02-21 13:00:03	AriettaWren	it's a struggle starting out
2016-02-21 13:00:07	AriettaWren	you just have to overcome it
2016-02-21 13:00:15	AriettaWren	things that feel weird stop feeling weird in time, with practice
2016-02-21 13:00:23	japex	idk im still bad at dota
2016-02-21 13:00:25	japex	500 hours in
2016-02-21 13:00:26	japex	lol
2016-02-21 13:00:28	AriettaWren	and I still have a long ways to go in terms of not making mistakes
2016-02-21 13:00:34	AriettaWren	oh it'll take more than 500 hours heh
2016-02-21 13:01:08	japex	To my untrained ear your performances all sound lovely
2016-02-21 13:01:19	AriettaWren	you have 657,000 hours though on average
2016-02-21 13:01:20	AriettaWren	in a lifetime
2016-02-21 13:01:31	japex	Another friend of mine pleases guitar, but he uses an amp and he likes a lot of distortion
2016-02-21 13:01:36	japex	I personally hate the way it sounds
2016-02-21 13:01:44	AriettaWren	I just play a nylon string classical guitar heh
2016-02-21 13:01:51	AriettaWren	nothing but a mic
2016-02-21 13:01:53	japex	Sounds better to me
2016-02-21 13:01:59	japex	Acoustic and bass <3
2016-02-21 13:02:03	AriettaWren	I could use better recording equipment
2016-02-21 13:02:15	japex	*plays
2016-02-21 13:02:36	AriettaWren	and a soundproof room with good acoustics
2016-02-21 13:02:50	AriettaWren	I'll invest in it one day
2016-02-21 13:02:52	japex	All that's expensive
2016-02-21 13:02:55	AriettaWren	right now I just have a usb mic
2016-02-21 13:03:00	japex	You could just tape a bunch of egg cartons to your walls
2016-02-21 13:03:04	AriettaWren	lol
2016-02-21 13:03:08	japex	Not sure if that's actually effective, but people say that it is
2016-02-21 13:03:10	japex	(some)
2016-02-21 13:03:13	japex	(possibly a joke)
2016-02-21 13:03:15	japex	(not sure)
2016-02-21 13:03:23	AriettaWren	I'm unfamiliar with it myself
2016-02-21 13:03:32	AriettaWren	I'll look into the cost when I have anything to spend heh
2016-02-21 13:07:45	AriettaWren	http://i.4cdn.org/pol/1456047373728.webm lol

2016-02-21 13:09:45	japex	AriettaWren: i tried playing dark souls, but it was too hard.
2016-02-21 13:09:53	japex	i got stuck in one area so i just grinded it over and over
2016-02-21 13:09:58	AriettaWren	It's my favorite game
2016-02-21 13:09:59	japex	then i stopped playing 
2016-02-21 13:10:14	AriettaWren	grinding isn't really helpful :p
2016-02-21 13:10:15	japex	The controls felt a little off even with my Dualshock 2 I bought just
2016-02-21 13:10:16	japex	to play
2016-02-21 13:10:28	AriettaWren	I love the controls
2016-02-21 13:10:39	japex	I have Dark Souls 2 as well, but I haven't left the tutorial area place like thing in that 1
2016-02-21 13:10:42	AriettaWren	they feel really good once you're familiar
2016-02-21 13:10:50	japex	my favorite game i haven't really played much is pathologic
2016-02-21 13:10:56	AriettaWren	I tried that
2016-02-21 13:10:56	japex	i like the atmosphere and the narrative
2016-02-21 13:11:03	AriettaWren	I didn't follow it so well
2016-02-21 13:11:17	AriettaWren	didn't hold my interest mechanically, I like games lol
2016-02-21 13:11:21	japex	transistor was neat
2016-02-21 13:11:29	japex	i loved undertale
2016-02-21 13:11:32	AriettaWren	dark souls does super well
2016-02-21 13:11:36	AriettaWren	in terms of hitting on all fronts
2016-02-21 13:11:45	japex	portal was fun
2016-02-21 13:11:48	AriettaWren	with atmosphere, game mechanics, setting
2016-02-21 13:11:49	japex	portal 2 got too hard after like 10 hours in
2016-02-21 13:11:56	japex	when u start dickin with the goops
2016-02-21 13:11:59	japex	n stuff
2016-02-21 13:12:16	japex	if i could not suck at dark souls
2016-02-21 13:12:18	japex	i'd like it better
2016-02-21 13:14:42	AriettaWren	you'd not suck as you kept playing
2016-02-21 13:14:50	AriettaWren	I got stuck on a boss for a couple of weeks
2016-02-21 13:14:57	AriettaWren	trying 5-10 times a day

2016-02-21 13:15:28	AriettaWren	been playing it since it came out on pc
2016-02-21 13:16:14	AriettaWren	it's an annoying floaty pope thing that has a dragon it constantly resurrects from the dead
2016-02-21 13:16:47	AriettaWren	occasionally it posesses the dragon and if you kill the dragon while it's posessed you get a large window to nock out chunks of his health
2016-02-21 13:17:14	AriettaWren	but with my current party, and char, I have to go through like 4 cycles of that to kill him, and I can't even complete a second cycle

2016-02-21 13:18:48	AriettaWren	what was the problem?
2016-02-21 13:18:53	AriettaWren	once you did know that
2016-02-21 13:18:59	japex	there wasn't 1
2016-02-21 13:19:03	japex	after i knew that
2016-02-21 13:19:03	japex	lol
2016-02-21 13:19:07	japex	thx tutorial
2016-02-21 13:19:14	AriettaWren	so why did you quit?
2016-02-21 13:19:15	japex	that was cheating
2016-02-21 13:19:23	AriettaWren	ah
2016-02-21 13:19:29	japex	there's no satisfication in accompishing something because you looked up how to do it
2016-02-21 13:19:33	AriettaWren	that's cute, but that's basically all of dark souls
2016-02-21 13:19:40	AriettaWren	knowledge of the game and mechanics
2016-02-21 13:19:48	AriettaWren	and once you know it you can't forget it
2016-02-21 13:19:59	japex	usually through self-exploration and 
2016-02-21 13:20:03	japex	intelligence + skill
2016-02-21 13:20:07	japex	are those things learned
2016-02-21 13:20:09	japex	and applied
2016-02-21 13:20:13	DanGan_OS[PsyD]	AriettaWren
2016-02-21 13:20:15	AriettaWren	yeah
2016-02-21 13:20:23	japex	having another person teach you makes it sorta sad
2016-02-21 13:20:23	DanGan_OS[PsyD]	I think patience is basically all of dark souls
2016-02-21 13:20:32	AriettaWren	DanGan_OS[PsyD], lol no
2016-02-21 13:20:34	DanGan_OS[PsyD]	If you have no patience, you suck at dark souls
2016-02-21 13:20:34	japex	cause they didn't have to youtube a video tutorial
2016-02-21 13:20:38	AriettaWren	it's just knowledge of game mechanics
2016-02-21 13:20:40	DanGan_OS[PsyD]	Forever
2016-02-21 13:20:43	AriettaWren	once you're familair with the game
2016-02-21 13:20:45	DanGan_OS[PsyD]	I dunno AriettaWren 
2016-02-21 13:20:50	AriettaWren	you can just run through with a 2h weapon and no shield
2016-02-21 13:20:54	AriettaWren	no patience whatsoever
2016-02-21 13:20:59	AriettaWren	and just rush everything
2016-02-21 13:21:04	DanGan_OS[PsyD]	You have to "know" that 2h weapons are good
2016-02-21 13:21:09	AriettaWren	:p
2016-02-21 13:21:13	DanGan_OS[PsyD]	Which means
2016-02-21 13:21:20	DanGan_OS[PsyD]	You have to have the patience to find that weapon
2016-02-21 13:21:22	AriettaWren	anyway japex you don't have to feel so bad about reading about dark souls
2016-02-21 13:21:26	japex	the only video game i ever beat by myself 
2016-02-21 13:21:27	AriettaWren	especially when you get into the pvp
2016-02-21 13:21:28	japex	was fable 2
2016-02-21 13:21:33	DanGan_OS[PsyD]	And the patience to use it without getting killed
2016-02-21 13:21:33	AriettaWren	that's cute
2016-02-21 13:21:45	AriettaWren	japex, I beat castlevania order of ecclesia myself
2016-02-21 13:21:46	japex	i used to make my dad play zelda for me as a kid
2016-02-21 13:21:52	DanGan_OS[PsyD]	And the patience to stick with the game
2016-02-21 13:21:55	AriettaWren	a few other things
2016-02-21 13:21:57	DanGan_OS[PsyD]	Even when it fucks you
2016-02-21 13:22:02	AriettaWren	I played dark souls 2 by myself
2016-02-21 13:22:06	AriettaWren	and dragon's dogma
2016-02-21 13:22:20	AriettaWren	I beat the main game, stuck on the boss in dlc
2016-02-21 13:22:46	AriettaWren	I think reading about dark souls 1
2016-02-21 13:22:58	AriettaWren	and feeling disappointed at the end that I didn't figure it out myself
2016-02-21 13:23:01	AriettaWren	but still having lots of fun with it
2016-02-21 13:23:10	AriettaWren	motivated me to ignore game tutorials and figure things out on my own
2016-02-21 13:23:17	AriettaWren	I haven't looked anything up since
2016-02-21 13:24:02	AriettaWren	once you know dark souls 1 also, any souls like game you have total familiarity with and you don't need to read about anything
2016-02-21 13:24:09	AriettaWren	demon's souls, dark souls 2, bloodborne
2016-02-21 13:24:15	AriettaWren	I could easily beat those on my own
2016-02-21 13:24:24	AriettaWren	just knowing how souls works
2016-02-21 13:24:41	AriettaWren	and I'm soooo excited about dark souls 3 :p

2016-02-21 13:30:13	AriettaWren	oh and the greatest thing about dark souls
2016-02-21 13:30:18	AriettaWren	is even when you familiarize yourself
2016-02-21 13:30:24	AriettaWren	with the gimmicks, and easy boss kills
2016-02-21 13:30:27	AriettaWren	for new players
2016-02-21 13:30:44	AriettaWren	you can approach the boss normally/ignore the gimick after
2016-02-21 13:30:55	AriettaWren	on a new game, self imposed restrictions, etc.
2016-02-21 13:31:12	DanGan_OS[PsyD]	>cucking yourself

2016-02-21 13:45:56	DanGan_OS[PsyD]	But she hates pvp

2016-02-21 13:47:53	AriettaWren	it's actually not so difficult just sprinting around doing running attacks with the great scythe unlocked
2016-02-21 13:48:03	AriettaWren	DanGan_OS[PsyD], that's because they're dumb
2016-02-21 13:48:08	DanGan_OS[PsyD]	You would get katana'd in any othe rcircumstance

2016-02-21 13:59:14	AriettaWren	when I had to kill the second one
2016-02-21 13:59:17	AriettaWren	to progress
2016-02-21 13:59:32	DanGan_OS[PsyD]	Lao-Shan is notoriously difficult

2016-02-21 14:00:12	AriettaWren	that you actually fight
2016-02-21 14:00:28	AriettaWren	as oppose to go through some linear environment
2016-02-21 14:00:29	DanGan_OS[PsyD]	I've never fought those two, actually

2016-02-21 14:01:12	DanGan_OS[PsyD]	The game is about timing your attcks

2016-02-21 14:01:21	AriettaWren	those fights aren't
2016-02-21 14:01:26	AriettaWren	that's my problem with them

2016-02-21 14:01:46	AriettaWren	you just wail on parts of their body with as much dps possible
2016-02-21 14:01:53	AriettaWren	to kill them within the time limit
2016-02-21 14:01:59	AriettaWren	they're usually attacking the vilage
2016-02-21 14:02:02	AriettaWren	*village

2016-02-21 14:07:49	DanGan_OS[PsyD]	Than what wii u will give them
2016-02-21 14:07:50	AriettaWren	just because it's so ugly on 3ds
2016-02-21 14:08:04	AriettaWren	and I'm used to it being pretty with emulated psp
2016-02-21 14:08:14	DanGan_OS[PsyD]	3ds is 50x more popular than wii u anyways
2016-02-21 14:08:38	DanGan_OS[PsyD]	It looks okay on n3ds

2016-02-21 14:10:51	AriettaWren	ye
2016-02-21 14:10:59	DanGan_OS[PsyD]	Freedom unite is probably second best portable monhun
2016-02-21 14:11:33	AriettaWren	I wish there were more games
2016-02-21 14:11:36	AriettaWren	that were so content rich
2016-02-21 14:11:55	DanGan_OS[PsyD]	You won't find one
2016-02-21 14:12:03	AriettaWren	dark souls :p
2016-02-21 14:12:06	DanGan_OS[PsyD]	Monster Hunter is the game to end all games

2016-02-21 14:12:13	DanGan_OS[PsyD]	Dark Souls is full of fluff

2016-02-21 14:12:23	japex	r-right guys

2016-02-21 14:12:28	AriettaWren	japex, lol
2016-02-21 14:12:55	AriettaWren	people that like story driven rpgs like that are the people that play mass effect and dragon age these days
2016-02-21 14:13:08	DanGan_OS[PsyD]	japex
2016-02-21 14:13:16	DanGan_OS[PsyD]	earthbound left a bigger mark on me
2016-02-21 14:13:19	AriettaWren	monster hunter and dark souls are evolutions of action rpgs like castlevania
2016-02-21 14:13:27	DanGan_OS[PsyD]	Mostly because it was the edgiest game created
2016-02-21 14:13:41	DanGan_OS[PsyD]	Ever
2016-02-21 14:13:41	AriettaWren	I'm not big on those types of games
2016-02-21 14:13:48	AriettaWren	I need muh action
2016-02-21 14:13:53	AriettaWren	muh interactive medium

2016-02-21 14:14:13	AriettaWren	I don't want to read a novel and select commands on a menu
2016-02-21 14:14:25	AriettaWren	watching some pixel art along the way
2016-02-21 14:14:25	AriettaWren	lol
2016-02-21 14:14:29	japex	play
2016-02-21 14:14:31	japex	super meat boy
2016-02-21 14:14:42	japex	and street fighter
2016-02-21 14:14:45	AriettaWren	I'd probably enjoy that, I appreciate art though
2016-02-21 14:14:46	DanGan_OS[PsyD]	I bet AriettaWren sucks at platformers
2016-02-21 14:14:50	DanGan_OS[PsyD]	And fighters
2016-02-21 14:14:51	AriettaWren	I'm not big on fighters surprisingly
2016-02-21 14:14:59	AriettaWren	I'm fine with platformers
2016-02-21 14:15:07	AriettaWren	2d action platformers are my favorite genre
2016-02-21 14:15:13	AriettaWren	but they have to have art and music right
2016-02-21 14:15:16	AriettaWren	to hold my interest
2016-02-21 14:15:16	japex	i like turn based strategy
2016-02-21 14:15:18	japex	2d platformers
2016-02-21 14:15:24	japex	arena fps
2016-02-21 14:15:31	japex	whatever fucking DOOM is
2016-02-21 14:15:31	DanGan_OS[PsyD]	I like all games
2016-02-21 14:15:35	DanGan_OS[PsyD]	Because I am a game dev
2016-02-21 14:15:37	japex	rts
2016-02-21 14:15:43	AriettaWren	I liked 2d action platformers and arpgs the most
2016-02-21 14:15:46	japex	and undertale + pokemon

2016-02-21 14:16:43	AriettaWren	 /v/ is retarded
2016-02-21 14:16:45	DanGan_OS[PsyD]	That's a long time for /v/
2016-02-21 14:16:46	DanGan_OS[PsyD]	All  things considered
2016-02-21 14:16:48	AriettaWren	 /v/ has people that dislike dark souls
2016-02-21 14:17:17	japex	idk bro
2016-02-21 14:17:19	AriettaWren	/v/ has people that think fighting games measure skill and ability
2016-02-21 14:17:21	DanGan_OS[PsyD]	 /v/ hates me
2016-02-21 14:17:26	japex	most of the time dark souls is being discussed on /v/
2016-02-21 14:17:30	AriettaWren	and think they aren't just memorization
2016-02-21 14:17:37	AriettaWren	and muscle memory
2016-02-21 14:17:37	japex	they're not
2016-02-21 14:17:39	japex	u have to react
2016-02-21 14:17:41	japex	accordingly
2016-02-21 14:17:43	AriettaWren	na
2016-02-21 14:17:45	japex	to your opponent
2016-02-21 14:17:50	japex	go watch lupe fisaco
2016-02-21 14:17:52	AriettaWren	it's just remembering combos and getting off combos
2016-02-21 14:17:54	DanGan_OS[PsyD]	japex
2016-02-21 14:17:54	japex	wreck a top tier player
2016-02-21 14:17:54	DanGan_OS[PsyD]	Strongly depends on the medium
2016-02-21 14:17:56	japex	in SF V
2016-02-21 14:17:59	DanGan_OS[PsyD]	And tha game
2016-02-21 14:18:00	AriettaWren	and whoever gets their endless combo off first
2016-02-21 14:18:01	AriettaWren	wins

2016-02-21 14:18:09	DanGan_OS[PsyD]	Opinion disregarded
2016-02-21 14:18:17	AriettaWren	it's literally just memorizing button progressions
2016-02-21 14:18:19	japex	most games dont allow endless combos
2016-02-21 14:18:21	AriettaWren	and it's really stupid imo
2016-02-21 14:18:24	AriettaWren	go learn an instrument
2016-02-21 14:18:26	japex	and there's strategy
2016-02-21 14:18:31	AriettaWren	I think fighting games are the dumbest things
2016-02-21 14:18:32	japex	to the combo exection
2016-02-21 14:18:33	AriettaWren	go play chess
2016-02-21 14:18:35	japex	because they can be stopped
2016-02-21 14:18:39	japex	i was playing chess.

2016-02-21 14:19:16	AriettaWren	I just need to refamiliarize myself with material value
2016-02-21 14:19:31	DanGan_OS[PsyD]	What does that mean
2016-02-21 14:19:48	AriettaWren	it's an approach to chess
2016-02-21 14:19:55	AriettaWren	that involves assigning a value to each piece
2016-02-21 14:20:00	japex	yeah
2016-02-21 14:20:02	AriettaWren	and trading/sacrificing them accordingly
2016-02-21 14:20:03	japex	queen = most valuable
2016-02-21 14:20:07	DanGan_OS[PsyD]	Nerd

2016-02-21 14:27:25	AriettaWren	I think my cat had a siezure
2016-02-21 14:27:36	AriettaWren	she fell off an endtable and landed on her back
2016-02-21 14:27:56	AriettaWren	and jerked her head, twitched her legs a couple times before getting back on her feet
2016-02-21 14:28:07	AriettaWren	she's old :/
2016-02-21 14:28:15	AriettaWren	she'll probably die in a year or so

2016-02-21 14:29:13	AriettaWren	that's actually doing really well for an indoor/outdoor cat
2016-02-21 14:29:22	AriettaWren	totally indoors live longer on average
2016-02-21 14:29:39	AriettaWren	and indoor outdoor live a little longer than outdoor but not much
2016-02-21 14:33:08	AriettaWren	but yeah, I'll see her fall off a table inside or nock something off totally by accident, slipping around
2016-02-21 14:33:10	AriettaWren	one second
2016-02-21 14:33:22	AriettaWren	and see her running along a fence with no mistakes another

2016-02-22 12:30:57	JimmyA	I have a mental illness that torments my very existance every single day and night.
2016-02-22 12:31:16	AriettaWren	JimmyA, what is it?
2016-02-22 12:31:22	JimmyA	schizophrenia
2016-02-22 12:31:48	JimmyA	but I have meds that help and people that support me, sometimes the illness is a blessing, but is a real pain in my sides
2016-02-22 12:32:06	moch	i dont take meds
2016-02-22 12:32:09	JimmyA	my sides are now in orbit
2016-02-22 12:32:25	moch	i just take benzos for anxiety
2016-02-22 12:32:50	AriettaWren	JimmyA, what kinds of things do you see/hear
2016-02-22 12:33:33	JimmyA	people that aren't their, people talking about me and a lot of weird colors and shapes. I can't really explain it all in words it would be to much of a library
2016-02-22 12:34:47	AriettaWren	has it ever endangered you?
2016-02-22 12:35:04	AriettaWren	is there certain stimulation that triggers it?

2016-02-22 12:38:05	moch	are you on ssi
2016-02-22 12:38:54	JimmyA	spring of 2015 was when I was hospitalized and diagnosis will still come down the road as new things appear. I have had weird hallucinations before I was diagnosed and then it really kicked in a year ago. I am on a drug called invega and it has helped, but no ssi takes a long time to go through the government.
2016-02-22 12:41:20	goatse911	Invega sustenna is a good treatment.  Just one shot every 14 days
2016-02-22 12:41:27	AriettaWren	how old are you?
2016-02-22 12:41:35	JimmyA	17
2016-02-22 12:41:40	goatse911	Schizophrenia typically occurs around the 20s

2016-02-22 12:44:02	JimmyA	um imagine looking at a tree and tree is swaying in the wind and you see all the little leaves turning and changing colors right before your eyes. A lot of times when Im walking around my town I will see people that aren't really there
2016-02-22 12:44:39	goatse911	aw:(
2016-02-22 12:44:42	JimmyA	I would go see a doctor for that
2016-02-22 12:44:43	AriettaWren	have you ever tried to interact with them? :p
2016-02-22 12:45:12	JimmyA	yes I talk to myself and sometimes respond to the voices in my head on rare occasions
2016-02-22 12:45:19	goatse911	I work with them for a living.  I try not to ask to intense questions as I usually work with schizophrenia in it's most acute phase.
2016-02-22 12:45:39	goatse911	I take ativan around the clock
2016-02-22 12:45:56	JimmyA	I also have Klonopin :^)
2016-02-22 12:45:57	goatse911	Difficulty making friends, frequent panic attacks around others.
2016-02-22 12:46:10	goatse911	is that enough to subdue hallucinations and delusions alone?
2016-02-22 12:46:32	goatse911	I sometimes wonder if treating my anxiety is the only reason I have no significant signs
2016-02-22 12:46:35	JimmyA	no but it calms me down to the point where I can take them like a champ
2016-02-22 12:46:37	AriettaWren	I just have avpd
2016-02-22 12:46:42	AriettaWren	I don't take anything
2016-02-22 12:46:52	goatse911	is that like adhd:P
2016-02-22 12:47:00	AriettaWren	no
2016-02-22 12:47:21	goatse911	I have that too... but I'm scared to take adderall.... my teeth are horrible and I get tremors/grind my teeth on it.
2016-02-22 12:47:33	goatse911	ah, always wondered jimmy
2016-02-22 12:47:42	goatse911	ty for not minding my questions
2016-02-22 12:47:59	goatse911	avoidant personality disorder arietta?
2016-02-22 12:48:14	goatse911	the thing with personality disorders... is that they are all a choice.
2016-02-22 12:48:39	goatse911	They enjoy being that way and choose to have that personality
2016-02-22 12:49:48	goatse911	why anyone has bpd I don't know...
2016-02-22 12:52:23	AriettaWren	err what?
2016-02-22 12:53:31	goatse911	borderline
2016-02-22 12:53:38	AriettaWren	no I mean
2016-02-22 12:53:41	AriettaWren	about the choice thing
2016-02-22 12:53:55	goatse911	it's true.
2016-02-22 12:54:09	goatse911	there's a reason why they had axis 1 and axis 2 in the DSM
2016-02-22 12:54:50	AriettaWren	you silly
2016-02-22 12:54:55	AriettaWren	I didn't choose my life
2016-02-22 12:55:03	goatse911	for instance, OCD is real distress that is unwanted thoughts/behavior.  Meanwhile the person with ocPd would enjoy making everything symmetrical.
2016-02-22 12:55:06	AriettaWren	yeah my reaction to it isn't a disorder
2016-02-22 12:55:12	AriettaWren	it's a perfectly natural reaction
2016-02-22 12:55:16	AriettaWren	but I didn't choose it
2016-02-22 12:55:19	AriettaWren	and it's something I have to overcome
2016-02-22 12:55:24	AriettaWren	I'd say it's worse even
2016-02-22 12:55:32	AriettaWren	to have to overcome what's a natural and core part of you and being human
2016-02-22 12:56:42	AriettaWren	I can't just take a drug and feel better
2016-02-22 12:56:45	goatse911	so the person with social anxiety feels panic and needs CBT... personality disorders generally don't feel the disorder part.  They would enjoy being alone
2016-02-22 12:57:03	goatse911	meds don't really work on axis II.
2016-02-22 12:57:22	goatse911	for avpd
2016-02-22 12:57:26	AriettaWren	as much as I'd "enjoy it"
2016-02-22 12:57:29	AriettaWren	it's not an option
2016-02-22 12:57:41	goatse911	>_>
2016-02-22 12:57:42	AriettaWren	you can't function in modern society or life
2016-02-22 12:58:34	goatse911	I definitely believe it intereferes with life...  But it's not really something organic causing it.
2016-02-22 12:58:46	goatse911	typically maladaptive behavior that is learned.
2016-02-22 12:59:20	AriettaWren	what's more organic than your childhood development?
2016-02-22 12:59:24	AriettaWren	and it getting shat on?
2016-02-22 12:59:39	AriettaWren	goatse911, you'd make an awful psychologist tbh
2016-02-22 12:59:49	goatse911	I mean chemical structure of the brain
2016-02-22 13:00:00	AriettaWren	goatse911, that's not an argument
2016-02-22 13:00:04	AriettaWren	and talking about it is meaningless
2016-02-22 13:00:09	AriettaWren	what's the purpose?
2016-02-22 13:00:09	goatse911	psychology is really the only tx for it
2016-02-22 13:00:12	goatse911	notta
2016-02-22 13:00:29	AriettaWren	goatse911, dick
2016-02-22 13:03:28	goatse911	are you sure you don't have Social Anxiety Disorder?

2016-02-23 05:22:22	stalkerr	online converters are good too right?
2016-02-23 05:22:26	&Segger	Or there's prolly a filesize cap on most of them to push 'premium'
