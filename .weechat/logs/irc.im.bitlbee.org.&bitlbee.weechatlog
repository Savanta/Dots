2016-02-17 07:58:32	@root	Welcome to BitlBee, your IRC gateway to ICQ, MSN, AOL, Jabber, Yahoo! and Twitter.
2016-02-17 07:58:32	@root	 
2016-02-17 07:58:32	@root	The center of BitlBee is the control channel, &bitlbee. Two users will always be there, you (where "you" is the nickname you are using) and the system user, root.
2016-02-17 07:58:32	@root	 
2016-02-17 07:58:32	@root	You need register so that all your IM settings (passwords, contacts, etc) can be saved on the BitlBee server. It's important that you pick a good password so no one else can access your account. Register with this password using the register command: register <password> (without the brackets!).
2016-02-17 07:58:32	@root	 
2016-02-17 07:58:32	@root	Be sure to remember your password. The next time you connect to the BitlBee server you will need to identify <password> so that you will be recognised and logged in to all the IM services automatically.
2016-02-17 07:58:32	@root	 
2016-02-17 07:58:32	@root	When finished, type help quickstart2 to continue.
